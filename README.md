# My zsh config

This is simple script with my experimental zsh config.

I was never looking too much into what different shells are out there. My
first attempt with not default distro shell is zsh.

# How to install

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:mhlavac/my-zsh.git && \
cd my-zsh && \
./install.sh
```
