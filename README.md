# My zsh config

This is simple script with my experimental zsh config.

I was never looking too much into what different shells are out there. My
first attempt with not default distro shell is zsh.

# How to install

``` sh
sudo apt-get install wget && \
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhlavac/my-zsh/master/install.sh | sh
```
